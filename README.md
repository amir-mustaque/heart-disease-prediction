Heart Disease Prediction
Introduction
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making early detection and prevention critical. This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical and lifestyle factors. By leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest, this project aims to provide accurate predictions and insights into the factors contributing to heart disease.

Project Description
The Heart Disease Prediction project utilizes a dataset containing various features related to patient health, such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The goal is to classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

Key Features of the Project:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing the data, and selecting relevant features.
Model Implementation: Four different machine learning models are implemented:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies new cases based on a majority vote of the nearest neighbors.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that works well with both linear and non-linear data.
Decision Tree: A tree-structured classifier that splits data into branches to make predictions.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.
Model Evaluation: Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix. This ensures that the models are not only accurate but also generalize well to unseen data.
Visualization: Graphical representations of the decision tree and feature importance are provided to offer insights into how the models make decisions.
